## Machine Translation 

In this assignment, neural machine translation is applied in translating between Myanmar and English. Experiments with different types of attention mechanisms, including general attention, multiplicative attention, and additive attention are performed and evaluated for
effectiveness in the translation process.

## Training Data

The TUFS Asian Language Parallel Corpus (TALPCo) is an open parallel corpus consisting of Japanese sentences and their translations into Korean, Burmese (Myanmar; the official language of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar), Malay (the national language of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei), Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese and English. TALPCo is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. See the paper below for the details of TALPCo.

## Tokenizer for Myanmar Language

For tokenizing myanmar language, ùóÜùîÇùïé‚óê‚Ñùùóó Segmentation Tool from https://github.com/ye-kyaw-thu/myWord is used.

## MultiHeadAttentionLayer

MultiHeadAttentionLayer is modified by adding a attribute "att_mechnism". This is to specify the attention mechanisms('gen','mul','add').

## Model configuration

    hid_dim = 256,
    enc_layers = 3,
    dec_layers = 3,
    enc_heads = 8,
    dec_heads = 8,
    enc_pf_dim = 512,
    dec_pf_dim = 512,
    enc_dropout = 0.1,
    dec_dropout = 0.1

## Conclusion

In terms of training time and validation loss, general attention got the best performance. However, the margins are relatively small. So, genreally, the attention mechanisms do not make a significant impact on perforamce and computaional complexity. This might be differnt for a larger corupus.
